Before you proceed to list products, use this API to check if your shop has satisfied all requirements.\n**Tip**: We recommend that you run this check before any bulk updates to avoid listing issues. For example, sellers may change the delivery option to \"Shipped by seller\" but fail to add a shipping template, thus blocking the shop from listing products. In this case, the API would return `is_failed=true` for the `SHIPPING_TEMPLATE` check item and you can prompt the seller to fix the problem.",
